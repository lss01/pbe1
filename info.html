My name is Ling Siew Siew, I'm taking Diploma Information Technology(Technology Digital) track SAD(software & development) now in semester 4 which from DDT4A class. I believe true leadership is a quality many aspire to have, and only a few truly obtain, because in order to become a leader you must first learn to follow. I believe over the past 2 years this school has given me the knowledge, education and understanding to fulfill the qualities to become a prefect. If I were chosen I would follow with an open mind, with focus and with purpose. I would make sure to choose the right choice of action, all the while remembering those who will be affected by my decisions.<br><br>As a student I have the confidence to put forward any new ideas that can benefit others.Also I have the courage to make tough decisions and the compassion to listen to the needs of others, qualities which are essential for leading. I would like to conclude by telling you that I am proud of Politeknik and it would be a great honour to represent it in MPP. And I urge you to vote for me but I would also like to tell you: Vote wisely as that is the power you exercise; it can make or break the things you care about. Thank You!</h2></td>
